# ID3 Decision Tree 

# Background
This program was created by Cole McCall in the Spring 2022 Semester at Northwest Nazarene University. This program was created in order to complete the Decision Tree assignment requirements. All code for this project was written in C#.

# Purpose
The purpose of this program is to load in a training dataset, read the contents, and then build an iterative decision tree based on information gain

# How to Run the Program
1. Clone the decision tree repo to your pc
  - `git clone https://github.com/colemccall/DecisionTreeCSharp.git DecisionTree`


2. Using the recently cloned DecisionTree directory, navigate to the executable location
  - `cd DecisionTree\ML_DecisionTreeClassifier\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows`


3. Launch the GUI
  - `ML_DecisionTreeClassifier.exe`

Once you have cloned the decison tree repo and opened the decision tree app, you will have several options.

Program 1 was specifcally designed for COMP4330 Machine Learning class. This program is able to read in any training data file from the testDataA4 dataset. The testDataA4 dataset has two text files for each set of training tuples: a .in file and a .out file. The .in file contains the number of classes, their possible values, and then a list of tuples. The .out file contains the expected decison tree

Program 2 was designed to integrate the decsion tree project with training data created using ArcGIS. Using Worldview2 satellite imagery, training polygons are created by sampling areas of the image where the result is known. The band values for each polygon are calculated by averaging the value of each pixel within the polygon, and these tuples can be used to determine which bands contain the most information.

# Program 1: Using the TestDataA4 Dataset

By clicking the `Run Program 1` button, a new window is launched

By clicking on the select button in the top left, you will be able to select a file from the windows explorer. Make sure that this file is a .txt or .in file and follows specific file requirements

In addition, this GUI was created with 18 test datasets. These datasets are located in `ML_DecisionTreeClassifier/testDataA4`. Each of these datasets can be selected by clicking the corresonding button.

Once data has been selected, it will be read in and displayed in two places. Here is what the `golf.in` file looks like

In the left box, under the label `Display Text`, the contents of the file are printed out and displayed. This box shows how many classes there are, what the possible values of each class are, and how many answer possibilities there are.

At the top of the center box, under the label `Original Input File`, the raw contents of the file are shown in full. NOTE: Larger files will not be shown in full

At the bottom of the center box, under the label `Original Output File`, the expected decision tree results are shown in full. These results were calculated previously, but were not never verified.

At the top of the far right box, under the label `Decision Tree`, is the actual decision tree that was created using this program. There are some minor discrepencies that can be ignored for now, but will be addressed late.

At the bottom of the far right box, is a small message that explains how the results from the decision tree can be stored. If you want to save the results to a file, type in the name of the new file in the `Output File Name` box and click print. The results will be stored in `ML_DecisionTreeClassifier/outputs`

# Program 2: Creating Decision Trees Based on ArcGIS Polygons

By clicking the `Run Program 2` button, a different window is launched

At the current stage, this window is still a bit messy.

By clicking the `Select` button, the windows file explorer will be launched. This will allow you to select training data to build the tree.
If you are looking for what this training should look like or are struggling to export the data from ArcGIS, try using the data stored on [this shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/165VSdZHOWSoL0JYhdSIS8qL0oo2QHZBm?usp=sharing)

Several default training data files can also be selected, although the links may not work. The MaskRCNN training data is used to build a tree based off of two classes: `tree` and `not tree`. The SVM training data is used to build a tree based off of four classes: `black ash`, `white ash`, `unburned surface`, and `unburned tree`.

Once training data has been selected, a decision tree will be created and displayed in the window to the right. On the left are two boxes, one that displays the number of classes and possible answers. 


To save the decision tree to a .txt file, enter the name of the file you would like to create, then press `print`.

In the future, I would like to allow the user to add another input file once the tree has been built. This data will be classified based on the tree that has already been built and can be used to either validate known data or classify unknown data.

# Future Work
- Continuous Data Bugs
  - There are small minor issues with continuous data. For example, if no consensus split point can be reached then the split point defaults to zero. Most of the time there is enough data to find a split point, but some of the datasets do not have enough training tuples and so the split point defaults to zero
  - As a result, an incorrect split point will prove to have little (or no) information gain and can mess up the results as we are out of features. An example of this can be found by running the `toolittle.in` dataset
- Classification
  - Right now, this program creates a decision tree based off of a training dataset. This program could be adapted to train the tree based off a portion of samples and then classify tuples where the answer is unknown.
- GUI Changes
  - This program could be improved by adding more to the GUI
  - This program could also be adapted to create a command line application instead
- Training Data Selecter/Creator
  - It would involve quite a bit more work, but I believe that another window could be added to this GUI which would create a `.in` file to be used for building the decision tree. 
- OS 
  - At the moment, this program is dependent on the user being a Windows user. To select a file of your own, the program launches the microsoft windows file explorer
- Additonal Hyperparameters
  - GINI index, Entropy, Information Gain
  - `.csv`, `.txt`, `.in`, more
